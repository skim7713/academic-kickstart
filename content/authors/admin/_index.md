I am a Senior Lecturer and Assistant Director of the [Data Analytics and Policy Program](https://advanced.jhu.edu/directory/sanghoon-kim-leffingwell/) and a Faculty Affiliate at the [SNF Agora Institute](https://snfagora.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University. My primary research focuses on [authoritarian nostalgia](https://www.sanghoonkim.org/publication/dissertation/bookproject/) and related political behavior in post-authoritarian democracies. I further develop research projects in the intersection of domestic and international politics of China's expansion in Asia. My regional focus is on South Korea and other Asian democracies. I introduce various research methods in answering key research questions, including experiments and text and image analysis. I received my PhD in Political Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2022 and MA and BA at Korea University. My research has appeared in _International Journal of Press/Politics_, _International Studies Quarterly_, *Journal of East Asian Studies*, *Party Politics*, *Social Science Quarterly*, and *World Development*.
 
My research has received support from various sources, including a Faculty Grant Award from the [SNF Agora Institute](https://snfagora.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University, a [Taiwan Fellowship](https://taiwanfellowship.ncl.edu.tw/eng/index.aspx) from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan, a Doctoral Fellowship from the [Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange](http://www.cckf.org/en/), and multiple institutions at the University of Illinois.
