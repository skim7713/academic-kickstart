abstract: Democratic rule has been the modal political system since the Third Wave of democratization, but nostalgia for authoritarian rule still drive political behavior in many new democracies. Why do voters feel nostalgic for an authoritarian past in consolidated democratic societies? Defining authoritarian nostalgia as a positive affective attachment to the achievements from the former period of dictatorship, I examine this question with a focus on two key elements of authoritarian nostalgia: \textit{coping mechanism} and value orientation. Longing for the authoritarian past can function as a remedy for a lack of satisfaction with the new democratic regime and help construct a social identity that embraces core values from the authoritarian period. I argue that individual personality traits shape individual value orientation linked to the former dictatorship and that external threat perception enhances nostalgia for an authoritarian past as a solution to present discontents. I develop a reliable measure of authoritarian nostalgia and test my hypotheses with a stylized survey experiment in South Korea and Taiwan. This paper establishs a yet unexamined concept of authoritarian nostalgia and explains its lingering effects on political attitudes and voting behavior in two post-authoritarian democracies.
