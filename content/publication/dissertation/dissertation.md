abstract: Why do people feel nostalgic for a former dictator? Democratic rule has been the modal political system since the Third Wave of democratization, but the legacies of authoritarian rule and nostalgia for dictators still drive political behavior in many Third Wave democracies. Politicians often evoke the achievements of a former autocrat and parrot political rhetoric from the old regime. Voters respond with more positive sentiment towards the former dictator, romanticizing the authoritarian past, and casting votes for the successors of the dictator in the hope of restoring the authoritarian prosperity. My dissertation investigates the types of voters who feel nostalgic for an authoritarian past. Longing for the authoritarian past can function as a remedy for a lack of satisfaction with the new democratic regime and help construct a social identity that embraces core values from the authoritarian period. This dissertation project seeks to establish a yet unexamined concept of authoritarian nostalgia and explain its effects on political attitudes, preferences, and voting behavior in post-authoritarian democracies.

Why do people feel nostalgic for a former dictator? Democratic rule has been the modal political system since the Third Wave of democratization, but the legacies of authoritarian rule and nostalgia for dictators still drive political behavior in many Third Wave democracies. Politicians often evoke the achievements of a former autocrat and parrot political rhetoric from the old regime. Voters respond with more positive sentiment towards the former dictator, romanticizing the authoritarian past, and casting votes for the successors of the dictator in the hope of restoring the authoritarian prosperity.  Defining authoritarian nostalgia as positive affective attachment to the achievements from the former period of dictatorship, the theoretical argument starts with understanding authoritarian nostalgia as consisting of two distinct but related features: authoritarian nostalgia as a coping mechanism and a value orientation. Those individuals feeling insecure or sharing a psychological orientation toward authoritarianism under the new liberal regime may romanticize economic and social order from the past and construct strong attachment to an authoritarian past. Longing for the authoritarian past can function as a remedy for a lack of satisfaction with the new democratic regime and help construct a social identity that embraces core values from the authoritarian period. This dissertation project seeks to establish a yet unexamined concept of authoritarian nostalgia and explain political attitudes, asymmetric political bias, and voting behavior in post-authoritarian democracies.
