Journalism has long been presumed to serve as a check on the powerful, shedding
light on wrongdoing; however, as local newspapers reach market failure, extant theory
pre- dicts corruption will go unchecked. We operationalize corruption as federal
prosecutions for public corruption, defined by the US Department of Jus- tice as crimes
involving the abuse of public trust by government by federal, state, and local public
officials. We examine changes in the local news media ecosystems: first, whether
declines in legacy local newspaper employment and circulation are associated with
changes in prosecutions for public corruption; and second, whether efforts to supplement
watchdog journalism with non-profit journalism might mitigate associated
declines in federal prosecution for public corruption. Our findings suggest nonprofit
interventions in failing local commercial news markets may be an important safeguard
for keeping public officials accountable.
