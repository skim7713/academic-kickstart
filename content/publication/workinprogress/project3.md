Political nostalgia has been associated more closely with conservative ideologies but voter behavior from `Obama nostalgia' in the US and nostalgia for `Roh Moo-hyun' in South Korea may suggest that it may arise in any partisan hearts and minds. This begs the following questions: are liberals and conservatives equally nostalgic for a political past? This project aims to examine partisan differences in nostalgia for a political past. In doing so, I compare partisan patterns in \textit{why} individuals feel nostalgia and \textit{what} they are nostalgic for. I argue symmetric political nostalgia that people on either side of ideological spectrum are equally likely to be nostalgic for a political past. The theoretical argument understands political nostalgia as consisting of two mechanisms, a reflection of individual \textit{value orientation} and \textit{coping mechanism}, and show that both liberals and conservatives are not different in employing both mechanisms in evoking political nostalgia.
