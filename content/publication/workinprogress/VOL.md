This paper is an effort to find an
explanation for such variation in authoritarian legacies across post-authoritarian
democracies. To do so, I first discuss two key components of authoritarian legacies:
authoritarian inheritance and authoritarian reference. I describe the variations in
institutional inheritance and strategies for referring the past in the post-transition
political context. Second, I introduce an index of authoritarian legacies by combining
and developing different instruments measuring authoritarian inheritance and reference
across post-authoritarian countries. After discussing the key characteristics of the
authoritarian legacies index (ALI), I examine key predictors of authoritarian legacies,
with variables capturing pre- and post-transition features.
